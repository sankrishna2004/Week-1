# Week-1
This project develops a machine learning model to classify waste images into Organic and Recyclable categories. Using TensorFlow and Keras, a CNN analyzes a specific dataset, with OpenCV for image preprocessing and Matplotlib for visualizing data categories. The system automates waste separation, enhancing waste management efficiency.
